# Quantum Random Password Generator

The generator leverages the principles of quantum superposition and measurement to create highly random and secure passwords. The code defines a quantum circuit that initializes a set of qubits, applies Hadamard gates to create superposition, measures the qubits to obtain classical bit strings, and maps these bit strings to characters based on a predefined alphabet code. 

The password length is determined probabilistically based on the measurement outcomes, and a random selection of characters is made to form the password. The generator also includes the option to replace certain characters with numbers for added complexity. The resulting password is printed as the output of the function. This quantum random password generator offers a unique and robust approach to generating strong and unpredictable passwords for enhanced security.

This code repository contains a quantum random number generator implemented using the Qiskit library. The code defines two key functions: `real_map` and `QRandom`. The `real_map` function enables mapping a value from one range to another. The `QRandom` function generates a random number using quantum computations. It initializes a quantum circuit, applies Hadamard gates to the qubits, measures the qubits, and extracts the statevector. The non-zero elements in the statevector determine the random number, which is then mapped to a specified output range using `real_map`.
