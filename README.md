# Quantum Random Password Generator

The generator leverages the principles of quantum superposition and measurement to create highly random and secure passwords. The code defines a quantum circuit that initializes a set of qubits, applies Hadamard gates to create superposition, measures the qubits to obtain classical bit strings, and maps these bit strings to characters based on a predefined alphabet code. The password length is determined probabilistically based on the measurement outcomes, and a random selection of characters is made to form the password. The generator also includes the option to replace certain characters with numbers for added complexity. The resulting password is printed as the output of the function. This quantum random password generator offers a unique and robust approach to generating strong and unpredictable passwords for enhanced security."
